# Offensive Security Write-ups

This repository contains **technical offensive security write-ups** focused on
**attack-chain reasoning, source code analysis, privilege escalation, and Active
Directory exploitation** across Linux and Windows environments.

The emphasis is on **why vulnerabilities exist**, how they are **chained
together**, and how they can be **detected and mitigated** — not on
walkthrough-style command execution.

---

## 🎯 What This Repository Demonstrates

- Offensive security mindset and methodology
- Web application exploitation and logic flaws
- Source code review (PHP, insecure design patterns)
- Linux and Windows privilege escalation
- Active Directory attack paths and domain escalation logic
- Abuse of misconfigurations and broken trust boundaries
- Attacker and defender perspectives (detection & defense)

## 🐧 Linux Write-ups

- **Gavel** – Dynamic Rule Execution & Privilege Boundary Abuse  
  *Source-code–driven exploitation leading to full system compromise*

---

## 🪟 Windows Write-ups

- Coming soon

---

## 🏢 Active Directory

This section focuses on **enterprise-style Active Directory exploitation**,
emphasizing **attack paths, trust abuse, and domain escalation**, rather than
individual tool usage.

Topics include:
- Credential access and reuse
- Kerberos-based attacks
- ACL and delegation abuse
- Service account exploitation
- Domain dominance techniques
- Detection and mitigation strategies

---

## 🧠 Methodology

Each write-up follows a consistent structure:

1. High-level target overview
2. Root cause analysis
3. Attack chain explanation
4. Privilege escalation reasoning
5. Detection opportunities
6. Defensive mitigations

Screenshots and command output are included **only when they add technical
value**.
